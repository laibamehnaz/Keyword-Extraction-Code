INTRODUCTION\nThe formulation of query statements that capture both the salient\naspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information\nRetrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].\nCommercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and\nWindows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the\nquality of their queries using query operators such as quotation\nmarks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search\nto a particular site or type of file. These techniques can be useful\nin improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g.,\n[15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research\ncommunity in attempts to improve the quality of search results.\nIR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to\nspecify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced\nsyntax. Research on practical techniques to supplement existing\nsearch technology and support users has been intensifying in\nrecent years (e.g. [18][34]). However, it is challenging to\nimplement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.\nTypical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of\na series of tokens separated by spaces. There is generally an\nimplied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts\nsearch results to documents containing all query terms. De Lima\nand Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase\nrecognition, and expansion on Web search queries. They showed\nthat the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve\nresult precision in Web search. However, the value of advanced\nsyntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most\nusers do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand\nhow to use it [15]. Since it appears operators can help retrieve\nrelevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.\nIn this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail\nand propose alternative applications that do not require all users to\nuse advanced syntax explicitly. We hypothesize that searchers\nwho use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search\nexpertise that the majority of the user population does not; an\nassertion supported by previous research [13]. Studying the\nbehavior of these advanced search engine users may yield\nimportant insights about searching and result browsing from\nwhich others may benefit.\nUsing logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we\ninvestigate differences between the search behavior of those that\nuse advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the\ninformation those users target. We are interested in answering\nthree research questions:\n(i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax\nand other characteristics of a search?\n(ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax\nand post-query navigation behaviors?\n(iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax\nand measures of search success?\nThrough an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential\nanswers for each of these questions. A relationship between the\nuse of advanced syntax and any of these features could support\nthe design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or\nuse advanced users\" interactions to help non-advanced users be\nmore successful in their searches.\nWe describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this\nlog-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which\nwe focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this\nanalysis in Section 5. In Section 6 we discuss the implications of\nthis research, and we conclude in Section 7.\n2. RELATED WORK\nFactors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of\nthe document collection being searched, and a poorly developed\ninformation need can all influence the quality of the queries that\nusers submit to IR systems ([24],[28]). There has been a variety\nof research into different ways of helping users specify their\ninformation needs more effectively. Belkin et al. [4] experimented\nwith providing additional space for users to type a more verbose\ndescription of their information needs. A similar approach was\nattempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to\nelicit additional information about the search context from users.\nThese approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match\nretrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more\nrelevant search results [4]. However, in Web search, where many\nof the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model,\nlonger queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to\na small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved. It\nis not simply sufficient to request more information from users;\nthis information must be of better quality.\nRelevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion\n[9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the\nquality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding\ntheir information needs. In the case of RF, the user presents the\nsystem with examples of relevant information that are then used to\nformulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.\nIt has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain\ndue to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF\nto typical users [17]. Query suggestions offered based on query\nlogs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with\nlimited user burden. This approach is limited to re-executing\npopular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions\npresented to them [1]. In addition, both of these techniques do not\nhelp users learn to produce more effective queries.\nMost commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax\nthat allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.\nQuery modifiers such as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc+\" (plus), \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u02c6\u2019\" (minus), and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc  \" (double\nquotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query\nterms. Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms\nand phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used\nto restrict the search space. Queries created with these techniques\ncan be powerful. However, this functionality is often hidden from\nthe immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the\nsyntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo\nboxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to\naccess these features.\nLog-based analysis of users\" interactions with the Excite and\nAltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries\ncontained any advanced syntax [14][25]. This analysis can be a\nuseful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR\nsystems. Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30]\nhas shown that gathering more information about users can\nimprove the effectiveness of searches, but require more\ninformation about users than is typically available from\ninteraction logs alone. Unless coupled with a qualitative\ntechnique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be\ndifficult to associate interactions with user characteristics. In our\nstudy we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced\nsearch features within the typical search interface, and the\npotential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do\nuse advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of\nsearchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.\nOther studies of advanced searchers\" search behaviors have\nattempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have\nacquired. However, such studies are generally limited in size\n(e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as\nhealthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]). Nonetheless, they can give\nvaluable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system,\nor search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.\nQuerying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to\nbetter understand users [31] and support other users [16].\nIn this paper we study other search characteristics of users of\nadvanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is\nanything different about how these search engine users search,\nand whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do\nnot make use of the advanced features of search engines. To do\nthis we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting\nusers over a prolonged period.\nIn the next section we describe the data we use to study the\nbehavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those\nthat do not use this syntax.\n3. DATA\nTo perform this study we required a description of the querying\nand browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a\nperiod of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.\nTo obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting\nWeb users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.\nWhen downloading a partner client-side application, the users\nwere invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being\nanonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each\nuser) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1\nThe information contained in these log entries included a unique\nidentifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique\nbrowser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining\nwhich browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page\nvisited. This provided us with sufficient data on querying\nbehavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing\nbehavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to\nmore broadly investigate search behavior.\nIn addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we\nalso had relevance judgments of documents that users examined\nfor 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.\nThese judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained\nhuman judges at the time the data were collected. We use these\njudgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users\nvisited on their browse trail away from search result pages.\nWe studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who\nsubmitted millions of queries to three popular search \nenginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of\nthe study. To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four\noperators common to all three search engines: + (plus), \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 (minus),\n  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain\nor Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted\ncontained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of\nusers used query operators in any of their queries. In the\nremainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced\nsearchers. We acknowledge that the direct relationship between\nquery syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied\n1\nIt is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then\ntheir interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study.\n(and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a\nreasonable criterion for a log-based investigation. We conjecture\nthat these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search\nexpertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate\nbehavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.\nTo handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis,\nwe removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the\nstudy\"s 13-week duration. This left us with 188,405 users \u00e2\u02c6\u2019\n37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) \nnonadvanced users \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 whose interactions we study in more detail. If\nsignificant differences emerge between these groups, it is\nconceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically\nclassify users and adjust a search system\"s interface and result\nweighting to better match the current user.\nThe privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the\nentire course of the study: no personal information was elicited\nabout them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous\nidentifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no\nattempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in\nany way. All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and\nno information other than consent for logging was elicited.\nTo find out more about these users we studied whether those\nusing advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were\nnot observed in those who did not use this syntax. We focused on\nquerying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the\nuser groups. In the next section we describe in more detail the\nsearch features that we used.\n4. SEARCH FEATURES\nWe elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects\nof the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing,\nand search success. The query and result-click characteristics we\nchose to examine are described in more detail in Table 1.\nTable 1. Query and result-click features (per user).\nFeature Meaning\nQueries Per Second (QPS) Avg. number of queries per\nsecond between initial query\nand end-of-session\nQuery Repeat Rate (QRR) Fraction of queries that are\nrepeats\nQuery Word Length (QWL) Avg. number of words in query\nQueries Per Day (QPD) Avg. number of queries per day\nAvg. Click Position (ACP) Avg. rank of clicked results\nClick Probability (CP) Ratio of result clicks to queries\nAvg. Seconds To Click (ASC) Avg. search to result click\ninterval\nThese seven features give us a useful overview of users\" direct\ninteractions with search engines, but not of how users are looking\nfor relevant information beyond the result page or how successful\nthey are in locating relevant information. Therefore, in addition to\nthese characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of\nusers\" post-query browsing behavior. To do this, we extracted\nsearch trails from the interaction logs described in the previous\nsection. A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected\nvia a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and\nterminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page\nnot linked from the current page, closing of the active browser\nwindow, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes. More\ndetail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in\nprevious work [33]. In total, around 12.5 million search trails\n(containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the\nlogs for all users. The median number of search trails per user was\n30. The median number of steps in the trails was 3. All search\ntrails contained one search result page and at least one page on a\nhyperlink trail leading from the result page.\nThe extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of \npostquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users\"\nsearch sessions, the average duration of users\" search trails, the\naverage display time of each document, the average number of\nsteps in users\" search trails, the number of branches in users\"\nnavigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users\"\nsearch trails. All search trails contain at least one branch\nrepresenting any forward motion on the browse path. A trail can\nhave additional branches if the user clicks the browser\"s back\nbutton and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to\nthe next (if any) back operation. The post-query browsing features\nare described further in Table 2.\nTable 2. Post-query browsing features (per trail).\nFeature Meaning\nSession Seconds (SS) Average session length (in seconds)\nTrail Seconds (TS) Average trail length (in seconds)\nDisplay Seconds (DS) Average display time for each page on\nthe trail (in seconds)\nNum. Steps (NS) Average number of steps from the page\nfollowing the results page to the end of\nthe trail\nNum. Branches (NB) Average number of branches\nNum. Backs (NBA) Average number of back operations\nAs well as using these attributes of users\" interactions, we also\nused the relevance judgments described earlier in the paper to\nmeasure the degree of search success based on the relevance\njudgments assigned to pages that lie on the search trail. Given\nthat we did not have access to relevance assessments from our\nusers, we approximated these assessments using judgments\ncollected as part of ongoing research into search engine\nperformance.2\nThese judgments were created by trained human\nassessors for 10,680 unique queries. Of the 1,420,625 steps on\nsearch trails that started with any one of these queries, we have\nrelevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%). We use these\njudgments to approximate search success for a given trail in a\nnumber of ways. In Table 3 we list these measures.\n2\nOur assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to\nwhat would have been possible if we had been able to contact\nour subjects. We address this problem in a manner similar to\nthat used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that\nsince we cannot determine perceived search success, we\napproximate search success based on assigned relevance scores\nof visited documents.\nTable 3. Relevance judgment measures (per trail).\nMeasure Meaning\nFirst Judgment assigned to the first page in the trail\nLast Judgment assigned to the last page in the trail\nAverage Average judgment across all pages in the trail\nMaximum Maximum judgment across all pages in the trail\nThese measures are used during our analysis to estimate the\nrelevance of the pages viewed at different stages in the trails, and\nallow us to estimate search success in different ways. We chose\nmultiple measures, as users may encounter relevant information in\nmany ways and at different points in the trail (e.g., single \nhighlyrelevant document or gradually over the course of the trail).\nThe features described in this section allowed us to analyze\nimportant attributes of the search process that must be better\nunderstood if we are to support users in their searching. In the\nnext section we present the findings of the analysis.\n5. FINDINGS\nOur analysis is divided into three parts: analysis of query behavior\nand interaction with the results page, analysis of post-query\nnavigation behavior, and search success in terms of locating\njudged-relevant documents. Parametric statistical testing is used,\nand the level of significance for the statistical tests is set to .05.\n5.1 Query and result-click behavior\nWe were interested in comparing the query and result-click\nbehaviors of our advanced and non-advanced users. In Table 4\nwe show the mean average values for each of the seven search\nfeatures for our users. We use padvanced to denote the percentage of\nall queries from each user that contains advanced syntax (i.e.,\npadvanced = 0% means a user never used advanced syntax). The\ntable shows values for users that do not use query operators (0%),\nusers who submitted at least one query with operators (\u00e2\u2030\u00a5 0%),\nthrough to users whose queries contained operators at least \nthreequarters of the time (\u00e2\u2030\u00a5 75%).\nTable 4. Query and result click features (per user).\nFeature\npadvanced\n0% > 0% \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 25% \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 50% \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 75%\nQPS .028 .010 .012 .013 .015\nQRR .53 .57 .58 .61 .62\nQWL 2.02 2.83 3.40 3.66 4.04\nQPD 2.01 3.52 2.70 2.66 2.31\nACP 6.83 9.12 10.09 10.17 11.37\nCP .57 .51 .47 .47 .47\nASC 87.71 88.16 112.44 102.12 79.13\n%Users 79.90% 20.10% .79% .18% .04%\nWe compared the query and result click features of users who did\nnot use any advanced syntax (padvanced = 0%) in any of their\nqueries with those who used advanced syntax in at least one query\n(padvanced > 0%). The columns corresponding to these two groups\nare bolded in Table 4. We performed an independent measures \nttest between these groups for each of the features. Since this\nanalysis involved many features, we use a Bonferroni correction\nto control the experiment-wise error rate and set the alpha level\n(\u00ce\u00b1) to .007, i.e., .05 divided by the number of features. This\ncorrection reduces the number of Type I errors i.e., rejecting null\nhypotheses that are true. All differences between the groups were\nstatistically significant (all t(188403) \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 2.81, all p \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 .002).\nHowever, given the large sample sizes, all differences in the\nmeans were likely to be statistically significant. We applied a\nCohen\"s d-test to determine the effect size for each of the\ncomparisons between the advanced and non-advanced user\ngroups. Ordering in descending order by effect size, the main\nfindings are that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search\nengine users:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Query less frequently in a session (d = 1.98)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Compose longer queries (d = .69)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Click further down the result list (d = .67)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Submit more queries per day (d = .49)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Are less likely to click on a result (d = .32)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Repeat queries more often (d = .16)\nThe increased likelihood that advanced search engine users will\nclick further down the result list implies that they may be less\ntrusting of the search engines\" ability to rank the most relevant\ndocument first, that they are more willing to explore beyond the\nmost popular pages for a given query, that they may be submitting\ndifferent types of queries (e.g., informational rather than\nnavigational), or that they may have customized their search\nsettings to display more than only the default top-10 results.\nMany of the findings listed are consistent with those identified in\nother studies of advanced searchers\" querying and result-click\nbehaviors [13][34]. Given that the only criteria we employed to\nclassify a user as an advanced searcher was their use of advanced\nsyntax, it is certainly promising that this criterion seems to\nidentify users that interact in a way consistent with that reported\npreviously for those with more search expertise.\nAs mentioned earlier, the advanced search engine users for which\nthe average values shown in Table 4 are computed are those who\nsubmit 50 or more queries in the 13 week duration of the data\ncollection and submit at least one query containing advanced\nquery operators. In other words, we consider users whose\npercentage of queries containing advanced syntax, padvanced, is\ngreater than zero. The use of query operators in any queries,\nregardless of frequency, suggests that a user knows about the\nexistence of the operators, and implies a greater degree of\nfamiliarity with the search system. We further hypothesized that\nusers whose queries more frequently contained advanced syntax\nmay be more advanced search engine users. To test this we\ninvestigated varying the query threshold required to qualify for\nadvanced status (padvanced). We incremented padvanced one\npercentage point at a time, and recorded the values of the seven\nquery and result-click features at each point. The values of the\nfeatures at four milestones (> 0%, \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 25%, \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 50%, and \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 75%) are\nshown in Table 4. As can be seen in the table, as padvanced\nincreases, differences in the features between those using\nadvanced syntax and those not using advanced syntax become\nmore substantial. However, it is interesting to note that as padvanced\nincreases, the number of queries submitted per day actually falls\n(Pearson\"s R = \u00e2\u02c6\u2019.512, t(98) = 5.98, p < .0001). More advanced\nusers may need to pose fewer queries to find relevant information.\nTo study the patterns of relationship among these dependent\nvariables (including the padvanced), we applied factor analysis [26].\nTable 5 shows the intercorrelation matrix between the features\nand the percentage of queries with operators (Padvanced). Each cell\nin the table contains the Pearson\"s correlation coefficient between\nthe two features for a given row-column pair.\nTable 5.

There are strong positive correlations between some of\nthe features (e.g., the number of words in the query (QWL) and\nthe average probability of clicking on a search result (ACP)).\nHowever, there were also fairly strong negative correlations\nbetween some features (e.g., the average length of the queries\n(QWL) and the probability of clicking on a search result (CP)).\nThe factor analysis revealed the presence of two factors that\naccount for 83.6% of the variance. As is standard practice in\nfactor analysis, all features with an absolute factor loading of .30\nor less were removed. The two factors that emerged, with their\nrespective loadings, can be expressed as:\nFactor A = .98(QRR) + .97(padv) + .97(QPS)\n+ .71(ACP) + .69(QWL)\nFactor B = .96(CP) + .90(QPD) + .67(ACP) + .52(ASC)\nVariance in the query and result-click behavior of our advanced\nsearch engine users can be expressed using these two constructs.\nFactor A is the most powerful, contributing 50.5% of the variance.\nIt appears to represent a very basic dimension of variance that\ncovers query attributes and querying behavior, and suggests a\nrelationship between query properties (length, frequency,\ncomplexity, and repetition) and the position of users\" clicks in the\nresult list. The dimension underlying Factor B accounts for\n33.1% of the variance, and describes attributes of result-click\nbehavior, and a strong correlation between result clicks and the\nnumber of queries submitted each day.\nSummary: In this section we have shown that there are marked\ndifferences in aspects of the querying and result-clickthrough\nbehaviors of advanced users relative to non-advanced users. We\nhave also shown that the greater the proportion of queries that\ncontain advanced syntax, the larger the differences in query and\nclickthrough behaviors become. A factor analysis revealed the\npresence of two dimensions that adequately characterize variance\nin the query and result-click features. In the querying dimension\nquery attributes, such as the length and proportion that contain\nadvanced syntax, and querying behavior, such as the number of\nqueries submitted per day both affect result-click position. In\naddition, in the result-click dimension, it appears that daily\nquerying frequency influences result-click features such as the\nlikelihood that a user will click on a search result and the amount\nof time between result presentation and the search result click.\nThe features used in this section are only interactions with search\nengines in the form of queries and result clicks. We did not\naddress how users searched for information beyond the result\npage. In the next section we use the search trails described in\nSection 4 to analyze the post-query browsing behavior of users.\n5.2 Post-query browsing behavior\nIn this section we look at several attributes of the search trails\nusers followed beyond the results page in an attempt to discern\nwhether the use of advanced search syntax can be used as a\npredictor of aspects of post-query interaction behavior.\nAs we did previously, we first describe the mean average values\nfor each of the browsing features, across all advanced users (i.e.\npadvanced > 0%), all non-advanced users (i.e., padvanced = 0%), and all\nusers regardless of their estimated search expertise level. We then\nlook at the effect on the browsing features of increasing the value\nof padvanced required to be considered advanced from 1% to\n100%. In Table 6 we present the average values for each of these\nfeatures for the two groups of users. Also shown are the\npercentage of search trails (%Trails) and the percentage of users\n(%Users) used to compute the averages.\nTable 6.

Once again, the columns of interest in this\ncomparison are bolded. As we did in Section 5.1 for query and\nresult-click behavior, we performed an independent measures \nttest between the values reported for each of the post-query\nbrowsing features. The results of this test suggest that differences\nbetween those that use advanced syntax and those that do not are\nsignificant (t(12495029) \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 3.09, p \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 .002, \u00ce\u00b1 = .008). Given the\nsample sizes, all of the differences between means in the two\ngroups were significant. However, we once again applied a\nCohen\"s d-test to determine the effect size. The findings (ranked\nin descending order based on effect size), show that relative to\nnon-advanced users, advanced search engine users:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Revisit pages in the trail less often (d = .45)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Spend less time traversing each search trail (d = .38)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Spend less time viewing each document (d = .28)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Branch (i.e., proceed to new pages following a back\noperation) less often (d = .18)\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Follow search trails with fewer steps (d = .16)\nIt seems that advanced users use a more directed searching style\nthan non-advanced users. They spend less time following search\ntrails and view the documents that lie on those trails for less time.\nThis is in accordance with our earlier proposition that advanced\nusers seem able to discern document relevance in less time.\nAdvanced users also tend to deviate less from a direct path as they\nsearch, with fewer revisits to previously-visited pages and less\nbranching during their searching.\nAs we did in the previous section, we increased the padvanced\nthreshold one point at a time. With the exception of number of\nback operations (NB), the values attributable to each of the\nfeatures change as padvanced increased. It seems that the differences\nnoted earlier between non-advanced users and those that use any\nadvanced syntax become more significant as padvanced increases.\nAs in the previous section, we conducted a factor analysis of these\nfeatures and padvanced. Table 7 shows the intercorrelation matrix\nfor all these variables.\nTable 7. Intercorrelation matrix (post-query browsing).\npadv SS TS DS NS NB NBA\npadv 1.00 .977 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019.843 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019.867 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019.395 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019.339 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019.249\nSS 1.00 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019.765 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019.875 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019.374 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019.335 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019.237\nTS 1.00 .948 .387 .281 .250\nDS 1.00 .392 .344 .257\nNS 1.00 .891 .934\nNB 1.00 .918\nNBA 1.00\nAs the proportion of queries containing advanced syntax\nincreases, the values of many of the post-query browsing features\ndecrease. Only the average session time (SS) exhibits a strong\npositive correlation with padvanced. The factor analysis revealed the\npresence of two factors that account for 89.8% of the variance.\nOnce again, all features with an absolute factor loading of .30 or\nless were removed. The two factors that emerged, with their\nrespective loadings, can be expressed as:\nFactor A = .95(DS) + .88 (TS) \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 .91(SS) \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 .95(padv)\nFactor B = .99(NBA) + .93(NS) + .91(NB)\nVariance in the query and result-click behavior of those who use\nquery operators can be expressed using these two constructs.\nFactor A is the most powerful, contributing 50.1% of the variance.\nIt appears to represent a very basic temporal dimension that\ncovers timing and percentage of queries with advanced syntax,\nand suggests a negative relationship between time spent searching\nand overall session time, and a negative relationship between time\nspent searching and padvanced. The navigation dimension\nunderlying Factor B accounts for 39.7% of the variance, and\ndescribes attributes of post-query navigation, all of which seem to\nbe strongly correlated with each other but not padvanced or timing.\nSummary: In this section we have shown that advanced users\"\npost-query browsing behavior appears more directed than that of\nnon-advanced users. Although their search sessions are longer,\nadvanced users follow fewer search trails during their sessions,\n(i.e., submit fewer queries), their search trails are shorter, and\ntheir trails exhibit fewer deviations or regressions to previously\nencountered pages. We also showed that as padvanced increases,\nsession time increases (perhaps more advanced users are\nmultitasking between search and other operations), and search\ninteraction becomes more focused, perhaps because advanced\nusers are able target relevant information more effectively, with\nless need for regressions or deviations in their search trails.\nAs well as interaction behaviors such as queries, result clicks, and\npost-query browse behavior, another important aspect of the\nsearch process is the attainment of information relevant to the\nquery. In the next section we analyze the success of advanced and\nnon-advanced users in obtaining relevant information.\n5.3 Search success\nAs described earlier, we used six-level relevance judgments\nassigned to query-document pairs as an approximate measure of\nsearch success based on documents encountered on search trails.\nHowever, the queries for which we have judgments generally did\nnot contain advanced operators. To maximize the likelihood of\ncoverage we removed advanced operators from all queries when\nretrieving the relevance judgments. The mean average relevance\njudgment values for each of the four metrics - first, last, average,\nand maximum - are shown in Table 8 for non-advanced users\n(0%) and advanced users (> 0%).\nTable 8. Search success (min. = 1, max. = 6) (per trail).\nFeature\npadvanced\n0% > 0% \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 25% \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 50% \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 75%\nFirst M 4.03 4.19 4.24 4.26 4.57\nSD 1.58 1.56 1.34 1.38 1.27\nLast M 3.79 3.92 4.00 4.13 4.35\nSD 1.60 1.57 1.29 1.25 .89\nMax.

M 3.93 4.06 4.08 4.08 4.26\nSD 1.57 1.51 1.23 1.32 1.14\nThe findings suggest that users who use advanced syntax at all\n(padvanced > 0%) were more successful - across all four \nmeasuresthan those who never used advanced syntax (padvanced = 0%). Not\nonly were these users more successful in their searching, but they\nwere consistently more successful (i.e., the standard deviation in\nrelevance scores is lower for advanced users and continues to drop\nas padvanced increases). The differences in the four mean average\nrelevance scores for each metric between these two user groups\nwere significant with independent measures t-tests (all t(516765)\n\u00e2\u2030\u00a5 3.29, p \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 .001, \u00ce\u00b1 = .0125). As we increase the value of padvanced\nas in previous sections, the average relevance score across all\nmetrics also increases (all Pearson\"s R \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 .654), suggesting that\nmore advanced users are also more likely to succeed in their\nsearching. The searchers that use advanced operators may have\nadditional skills in locating relevant information, or may know\nwhere this information resides based on previous experience.3\nDespite the fact that the four metrics targeted different parts of the\nsearch trail (e.g., first vs. last) or different ways to gather relevant\ninformation (e.g., average vs. maximum), the differences between\ngroups and within the advanced group were consistent.\n3\nAlthough in our logs there was no obvious indication of more\nrevisitation by advanced search engine users.\nTo see whether there were any differences in the nature of the\nqueries submitted by advanced search engine users, we studied the\ndistribution of the four advanced operators: quotation marks, plus,\nminus, and site:. In Table 9 we show how these operators were\ndistributed in all queries submitted by these users.\nTable 9. Distribution of query operators.\nFeature\npadvanced\n> 0% \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 25% \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 50% \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 75%\nQuotes () 71.08 77.09 70.33 70.00\nPlus (+) 6.84 13.31 19.21 33.90\nMinus (\u00e2\u02c6\u2019) 6.62 2.88 1.96 2.42\nSite: 21.55 12.72 13.04 9.86\nAvg. num. operators 1.08 1.14 1.28 1.49\nThe distribution of the quotes, plus, and minus operators are\nsimilar amongst the four levels of padvanced, with quotes being the\nmost popular of the four operators used. However, it appears that\nthe plus operator is the main differentiator between the padvanced\nuser groups. This operator, which forces the search engine to\ninclude in the query terms that are usually excluded by default\n(e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference\nin observed search success.4\nHowever, this does not capture the\ncontribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in\nrelevance compared with excluding the operator. To gain some\ninsight into this, we examined the impact that each of the\noperators had on the relevance of retrieved results. We focused\non queries in padvanced > 0% where the same user had issued a\nquery without operators and the same query with operators either\nbefore or afterwards. Although there were few queries with\nmatching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there\nwas a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average\nrelevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with\nquotes in the initial query. It may be the case that quoted queries\nled to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better\nmatch the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead\nto judged documents receiving higher scores. More analysis\nsimilar to [8] is required to test these propositions further.\nSummary: In this section we have used several measures to study\nthe search success of advanced and non-advanced users. The\nfindings of our analysis suggest that advanced search engine users\nare more successful and have more consistency in the relevance of\nthe pages they visit. Their additional search expertise may make\nthese users better able to make better decisions about which\ndocuments to view, meaning they encounter consistently more\nrelevant information on their searches. In addition, within the\ngroup of advanced users there is a strong correlation between\npadvanced and the degree of search success. Advanced search\nengine users may be more adept at combining query operators to\nformulate powerful query statements. We now discuss the\nfindings from all three subsections and their implications for the\ndesign of improved Web search systems.\n4\nIt is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the\ndistribution of usage of the three search engines - Google,\nYahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced search\nengine users, or between advanced users and non-advanced.\n6. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS\nOur findings indicate significant differences in the querying,\nresult-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those\nthat use advanced syntax versus those that do not. Many of these\nfindings mirror those already found in previous studies with\ngroups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19]. There are\nseveral ways in which a commercial search engine system might\nbenefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise. This\nmight be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it\nmay be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer\ndifferent pages than novice searchers. The user interface to a\nsearch engine might be tailored to a user\"s expertise level; perhaps\neven more advanced features such as term weighting and query\nexpansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced\nsearchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for\nnovices. Result presentation might also be customized based on\nsearch skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of\ncontent snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different\noutcomes for different expertise levels. Additionally, if browsing\nhistories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers\ncould be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and\npotentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].\nThe use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to\nguide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the\ndesigners of search systems. In part, these searchers may have\nmore post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome\nthe shortcomings of search systems [29]. Their interactions can\nbe used to point users to places that advanced search engine users\nvisit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to\nsearch more effectively. However, if expert users are going to be\nused in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.\nOur advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose\ninteractions we studied. Whilst these may be amongst the most\nactive users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover\nlarge number of subject areas. However, rather than focusing on\nwhere they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with\ndomain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use\nmoves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn\nfrom. Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn\nhow to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching\nstyle of expert searchers could help them learn more successful\npost-query interactions.\nOne potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior\nresearch, it has been shown that query operators do not\nsignificantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8],\nand that searchers may be able to perform just as well without\nthem [27]. It could therefore be argued that the users who do not\nuse query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not\nwaste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query\nstatements. However, this seems unlikely given that those who\nuse advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users\nwith expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.\nHowever, in future work we will expand of definition of\nadvanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include\nother interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this\nstudy, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12].\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we have described a log-based study of search\nbehavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of\nadvanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search\nbehavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query\nnavigation, and search success. Those that use this syntax are\nactive online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing\nsearch trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely\nto explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are\nmore successful in there searching. These are all traits that we\nwould expect expert searchers to exhibit. Crude classification of\nusers based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the\nquery stream yields remarkable results about the interaction\nbehavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do. As\nwe have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions\nof these users for improved document ranking, page\nrecommendation, or even user training. Future work will include\nthe development of search interfaces and modified retrieval\nengines that make use of these information-rich features, and\nfurther investigation into the use of these features as indicators of\nsearch expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between\nresult click and post-query behavior.\n8.
