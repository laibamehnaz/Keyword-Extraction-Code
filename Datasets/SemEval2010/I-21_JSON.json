Our\nmodel of a mechanism for transmitting word-of-mouth and\nthe resulting behavioural effects is based on integrating a\nmodule governing the local behaviour of agents with a \nmodule governing the structure and function of the underlying\nnetwork of agents. Local behaviour incorporates a \nsatisficing model of choice, a set of rules governing the \ninteractions between agents, including learning about the \ntrustworthiness of other agents over time, and external constraints\non behaviour that may be imposed by market barriers or\nswitching costs. Local behaviour takes place on a network\nsubstrate across which agents exchange positive and \nnegative information about products. We use various degree\ndistributions dictating the extent of connectivity, and \nincorporate both small-world effects and the notion of preferential\nattachment in our network models. We compare the \neffectiveness of referral systems over various network structures\nfor easy and hard choice tasks, and evaluate how this \neffectiveness changes with the imposition of market barriers.\nCategories and Subject Descriptors\nI.2.11 [Artificial Intelligence]: Distributed Artificial \nIntelligence\nGeneral Terms\nPerformance, Experimentation\n1. INTRODUCTION\nDefection behaviour, that is, why people might stop \nusing a particular product or service, largely depends on the\npsychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward\nthe currently-used product [14] and the availability of more\nattractive alternatives [17]. However, in many cases the \ndecision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on\nvarious external constraints that are placed on switching \nbehaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the \nsuppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts),\nor other so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcswitching costs\" or market barriers [12, 5].\nThe key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which\npsychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making\nis constrained by market barriers, so that agents are \nprevented from pursuing those courses of action which would\nbe most satisfying in an unconstrained market.\nWhile the level of satisfaction with a currently-used \nproduct will largely be a function of one\"s own experiences of\nthe product over the period of use, knowledge of any \npotentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained\nby augmenting the information gained from personal \nexperiences with information about the experiences of others \ngathered from casual word-of-mouth communication. Moreover,\nthere is an important relationship between market barriers\nand word-of-mouth communication. In the presence of \nmarket barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in \ndissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this\ninformation to other agents. In the absence of such \nbarriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products\nand word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be\nof the positive variety. Since the imposition of at least some\nforms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken\nby product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the\nsuccess of a particular supplier.\nIn addition, the relationship between market barriers and\nword-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one. The\nstructure and function of the network across which \nword-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the\nway in which the network changes in response to the \nimposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining\nwhich market barriers are most effective. These are complex\nquestions, and our main interest in this paper is to address\nthe simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which\nnetwork structure influences the ways in which information\nis disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the\nextent to which market barriers affect this dissemination,\nand (c) the consequent implications for overall system \nperformance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are \nsatisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards\nequilibrium, which we term stability.\nAn agent-based model framework allows for an \ninvestigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the\n387\n978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS\nproduct-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are \nparticularly interested in the implications of market barriers for\nthe latter two. The model presented here allows for an \ninvestigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried\nout in a complex environment where at every time period\neach agent in a population must decide which one of a set of\nproducts to purchase. These decisions are based on \nmultiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as\nwell as from the referrals of agents. Agents use this gathered\ninformation to search for a product that exceeds their \nsatisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may\nbe said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).\nMarket barriers may act to influence an agent to continue\nto use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory \nperformance. We allow agents to hold different opinions about\nthe performance of a product, so that as a result a referral\nfrom another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.\nAgents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of\nother agents\" referrals according to the success of past \nreferrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not\nto make use of any further referrals. The level of \nsatisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently\ndynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product\nperformance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount\nthe performance of a product they have used for a long time\n- a process akin to habituation.\n2. BACKGROUND\n2.1 Word-of-mouth communication\nMuch of the work done on word-of-mouth communication\nin the context of social psychology and marketing research\nhas focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that\nword-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be \ninduced by a particular transaction or product experience [11],\nparticularly when that transaction has been an especially\ngood or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10],\nusually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or\nnew [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and\nbrands arise in the course of informal conversation, \nparticularly when a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpassion for the subject\" is present [4]. \nWordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the\ncommunication is credible, with credibility decisions based\nlargely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional\nqualification, informal training, social distance [7], and \nsimilarity of views and experiences [3].\nThe role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour\nof complex systems has been studied in both analytical and\nsimulation models. The analytical work in [8] investigates\nthe conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to \nconformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient \noutcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better\nthan another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises\nwhen agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication\nfrom only a small number of other agents, but that this \nconformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the\ntendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms\nthe influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially\nefficient outcome. Simulation-based investigations of \nwordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for\nensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where\nall agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the \neffectiveness of others\" referrals or by varying the degree of \ninertia in individual behaviour. These studies have found that,\ngiven a sufficient number of service providers, honest \nreferrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions\nthan deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth\nprovide better performance than none at all. The \nsimulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the\nenvironment than the analytical models, in which referrals\nare at random and only two choices are available, and the\nwork in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work \npresented in this paper, our main contribution being to include\nnetwork structure and the constraints imposed by market\nbarriers as additional effects.\n2.2 Market barriers\nThe extent to which market barriers are influential in\naffecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from\neconomists interested in how barriers distort competition\nand marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer\nchoices. While the formalisation of the idea that \nsatisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the\nwork of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly\nall writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this\nrelationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).\nA useful typology of market barriers distinguishes \n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dctransactional\" barriers associated with the monetary cost of \nchanging (e.g. in financial services), \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclearning\" barriers associated\nwith deciding to replace well-known existing products, and\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dccontractual\" barriers imposing legal constraints for the term\nof the contract [12]. A different typology [5] introduces the\nadditional aspect of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelational\" barriers arising from \npersonal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of\na particular product.\nThere is generally little empirical evidence on the \nrelationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the \nretention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge\nno previous work using agent-based modelling to generate\nempirical findings. Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived\nmarket barriers account for nearly twice the variance in \nintention to stay with a product than that explained by \nsatisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and\nthat so-called relational barriers are considerably more \ninfluential than either transactional or learning barriers. Further,\nthey find that switching costs are perceived by consumers\nto exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers\nwould seem to be weak. Simply put, market barriers appear\nto play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction;\nand their presence may be more pervasive than is generally\nthought.\n3. MODEL FRAMEWORK\n3.1 Product performance evaluations\nWe use a problem representation in which, at each time\nperiod, every agent must decide which one of a set of \nproducts to choose. Let A = {ak}k=1...p be the set of agents,\nB = {bi}i=1...n be the set of products, and C = {cj }j=1...m\nbe the set of attributes on which the choice decision is to be\nbased i.e. the decision to be made is a multiattribute choice\none. Let fj : B \u00e2\u2020\u2019 [0, 1] be an increasing function \nproviding the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j (so\nthat 0 and 1 are the worst- and best-possible performances\nrespectively), and Sij : A \u00c3\u2014 [0, 1] \u00e2\u2020\u2019 [0, 1] be a subjective\nopinion function of agents. The intrinsic performance of\n388 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)\nproduct i on attribute j is given by fj (bi). However, the\nsubjective opinion of the level of performance (of product i\non attribute j) given by agent k is given by sij(ak, fj (bi)).\nAll subsequent modelling is based on these subjective \nperformance ratings. For the purposes of this paper, each agent\nbelongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group\npossessing its own subjective performance ratings.\nWe assume that the subjective performance ratings are\nnot known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to \ndiscover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration\nand referral gathering. In order to model this process we \nintroduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time\nt, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t). Initially, all perceived \nperformance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a\nproduct is done randomly. Subsequent variation in product\nperformance over time is modelled using two quantities: a\nrandom perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion\nensures that the experience of a particular product can vary\nover purchase occasions for the same agent, and a \nhabituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived\nperformance of a product over time as boredom creeps in\nwith repeated usage. Our habituation mechanism supposes\nthat habituation builds up with repeated use of a product,\nand is used to discount the performance of the product.\nIn most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or\nextremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting\neventually leads to defection, after which the level of \nhabituation dissipates as time passes without the product being\nused. More formally, once a product i\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\nhas been chosen by\nagent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and\npi\u00e2\u02c6\u2014j(ak, fj (b\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\ni ), t) is set equal to si\u00e2\u02c6\u2014j(ak, fj (b\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\ni ))Hi\u00e2\u02c6\u2014kt + jkt,\nwhere jkt is distributed as N(0, \u00cf\u0192) and Hi\u00e2\u02c6\u2014kt is an \ndecreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has\nbeen exposed to i\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\n.\nIn evaluating the performance of a product, agents make\nuse of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived\nperformance of the chosen product with their satisfaction\nthresholds \u00ce\u201ck = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 gik \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 1. Agent\nk will be satisfied with a product i\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\nselected in time t if\npi\u00e2\u02c6\u2014j(ak, fj (b\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\ni ), t) \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 gjk, \u00e2\u02c6\u20acj.\n3.2 Decision processes\nIn designing the mechanism by which agents make their\nchoice decisions, we allow for the possibility that satisfied\nagents defect from the products that are currently satisfying\nthem. Satisfied agents stay with their current product with\nprobability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied\nagents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when\nPr(stay) = 1.\nA defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to\nchoose by considering all other products for which it has\ninformation, either by previous personal exploration or by\nreferrals from other agents. The selection of a new \nproduct begins by the agent identifying those products from\nwhich he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance\non all attributes i.e. those products for which \u00ce\u00b4ik < 0, where\n\u00ce\u00b4ik = maxj [gjk \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a \nproduct from this set with selection probabilities proportional to\n\u00e2\u02c6\u2019\u00ce\u00b4ik. If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent\nis unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those\nproducts that offer at least a minimum level of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcacceptable\"\nperformance \u00ce\u00b3\u00e2\u02c6\u2019\nk . The minimum level of acceptability is \ndefined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations\nacross all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e.\na product is minimally acceptable if and only if \u00ce\u00b4ik < \u00ce\u00b3\u00e2\u02c6\u2019\nk .\nAgents then select a product at random from the set of \nminimally acceptable products. If the set of minimally \nacceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full\nset of products B at random.\nThe decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely\nsimilar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the \nexception that at the outset of the decision process agents will\nchose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the\nset of remaining products, with probability \u00ce\u00b1. With \nprobability 1 \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 \u00ce\u00b1, they will use a decision process like the one\noutlined above for satisfied agents.\n3.3 Constraints on decision processes\nIn some circumstances market barriers may exist that\nmake switching between products more difficult, \nparticularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of\nchanging one\"s choice of product. When barriers are present,\nagents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but\nrather only when the performance evaluation drops below\nsome critical level i.e. when \u00ce\u00b4ik > \u00ce\u00b2, where \u00ce\u00b2 > 0 measures\nthe strength of the market barriers. Although in this \npaper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is\nstraightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers\ntake the general form \u00ce\u00b2 = max(\u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u02c6\u2014 +\u00ce\u201dtuse, \u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\n), where \u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u02c6\u2014 is a\nbarrier to defection that is applied when the product is \npurchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), \u00ce\u201d is\nthe increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional\ntime period the product is used for, and \u00ce\u00b2\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\nis the maximum\npossible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary\nover products i.e. be a function of i.\n3.4 Referral processes\nEach agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents\ni.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.\nThe network over which word-of-mouth communication \ntravels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which \nnetworks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of\nagents into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccommunities\" and a short average path length\nbetween any two agents in the network, and preferential\nattachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of\nexisting connections are more likely to receive new ones.\nThis is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice\nwith connections between all agent pairs separated by \u00ce\u00ba or\nfewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network\nby choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections\nin the network and moving one end of each to a new agent,\nwith that new agent chosen with probability proportional to\nits number of existing connections. This results in a \ndistribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent\ni.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.\nIn fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified\nso that new connections are added with preferential \nattachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of\nqk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a\nnon-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal\nnumber of connections seems more realistic in the context\nof word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.\nWhen an agent purchases a product, they inform each\nof the other agents in their circle with probability equal to\nPr(spr)k\u00e2\u02c6\u2014 + |\u00ce\u00b4ik\u00e2\u02c6\u2014 |, where Pr(spr)k\u00e2\u02c6\u2014 is the basic propensity\nof agent k\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\nto spread word of mouth and \u00ce\u00b4ik\u00e2\u02c6\u2014 captures the\nThe Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 389\nextent to which the agent\"s most recent experience was \nsatisfying or dissatisfying. Agents are thus more likely to spread\nword-of-mouth about products that they have just \nexperienced as either very good or very bad. If an agent receives\ninformation on the same product from more than one agent,\nhe or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with\nselection probabilities proportional to Tt(k\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\n, k), the degree\nto which previous referrals from k\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\nto k were successful i.e.\nresulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents\nhave the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents\"\nreferrals and use this information to accept or block future\nreferrals. In this paper, we employ a learning condition in\nwhich Tt(k\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\n, k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an\nunsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying\nreferral. The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that\nemployed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an \nunsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a\nreferring agent k\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\ndoes not possess the same subjective \npreferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the\nconverse.\nOther referral process are certainly possible, for \nexample one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather\nthan choosing only the most-trusted source: our main \nreason for employing the process described above is \nsimplicity. Integrating different sources considerably complicates\nthe process of learning about the trustworthiness of others,\nand raises further questions about the precise nature of the\nintegration.\nAfter determining who contacts whom, the actual \nreferral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the\nperceived level of performance of an experience of product\ni\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\nfrom the referring agent k\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\nto the accepting agent k i.e.\npi\u00e2\u02c6\u2014j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi\u00e2\u02c6\u2014j(ak\u00e2\u02c6\u2014 , fj(bi), t\u00e2\u02c6\u20191), \u00e2\u02c6\u20acj,\nprovided that agent k is not currently using i\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\n. Information\nabout other products is not transmitted, and an agent will\nignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is\ncurrently using. In effect, the referral creates an expected\nlevel of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for\nthe product referred to, which that agent may then use when\nmaking choice decision in subsequent time periods using the\ndecision processes outlined in the previous section. Once an\nagent has personally experienced a product, any expected\nperformance levels suggested by previous referrals are \nreplaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels\nsij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k\u00e2\u02c6\u2014\n, k) is adjusted depending on\nwhether the experience was a satisfying one or not.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nWe examine the behaviour of a system of 200 agents \nconsisting of three groups of 67, 67, and 66 agents respectively.\nAgents in each of the three groups have homogeneous \nsubjective opinion functions Sij. Simulations were run for 500\ntime periods, and twenty repetitions of each condition were\nused in order to generate aggregate results.\n4.1 Choice task difficulty\nWe begin by examining the effect of task difficulty on\nthe ability of various network configurations to converge to\na state in which an acceptable proportion of the \npopulation are satisfied. In the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceasy\" choice condition, there are\n50 products to choose from in the market, evaluated over\n4 attributes with all satisfaction thresholds set to 0.5 for\nall groups. There are therefore on average approximately\n3 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular\nagent. In the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\" choice condition, there are 500 \nproducts to choose from in the market, still evaluated over 4\nattributes but with all satisfaction thresholds now set to\n0.7 for all groups, so there are on average approximately\n4 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular\nagent. Locating a satisfactory product is therefore far more\ndifficult under the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\" condition. The effect of task \ndifficulty is evaluated on three network structures \ncorresponding to r = 1 (random network), r = 0.05 (small-world \nnetwork), and r = 0 (tight \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccommunities\" of agents), with \nresults shown in Figure 1 for the case of \u00ce\u00ba = 3.\n0 100 200 300 400 500\n0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7\nTime\nProportionsatisfied\nEasy task\nr = 1\nr = 0.05\nr = 0\n(a) Proportion of agents satisfied\n0 100 200 300 400 500\n0.00.10.20.30.40.50.6\nTime\nShareofmarket\nEasy task\nr = 1\nr = 0.05\nr = 0\n(b) Market share for leading product\nFigure 1: Moderating effect of task difficulty on \nrelationship between network structure (r) and system\nbehaviour\nGiven a relatively easy task, the system very quickly i.e. in\nlittle over 50 time periods, converges to a state in which\njust less than 60% of agents are satisfied at any one time.\nFurthermore, different network structures have very little\ninfluence on results, so that only a single (smoothed) series\nis given for comparison with the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchard\" condition. Clearly,\nthere are enough agents independently solving the task i.e.\n390 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)\nfinding a satisfying brand, to make the dissemination of \ninformation relatively independent of the ways in which \nconnections are made. However, when it is more difficult to\nlocate a satisfying product, the structure of the network \nbecomes integral to the speed at which the system converges\nto a stable state. Importantly, the overall satisfaction level\nto which the system converges remains just below 60% \nregardless of which network structure is used, but convergence\nis considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a\nsmall proportion of connections. Thus while the random\nnetwork (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world \nnetwork (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over\nthe tight communities represented by the one-dimensional\nring lattice. This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much\nless pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g.\n\u00ce\u00ba = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a \nnetwork is a more important determinant of system behaviour\nthan the way in which agents are connected to one another.\nSimilar results are observed when looking at the market\nshare achieved by the market leading product under each\nlevel of choice difficulty: market share is essentially \nindependent of network structure for the easy task, with \naverage share converging quickly to around 35%. Set a more\ndifficult task, the convergence of market share to an \napproximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the \nsmallworld network, with the random and tight community \nnetworks taking different paths but similar times to reach their\nequilibrium levels. Also interesting is the finding that \nequilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be\nslightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network \nconnections are non-random - the random network seems to\nsuffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other\nnetworks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the \nmarket leading product.\n4.2 Market barriers\nIn the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of\nvarious forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of\nagents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction. For \nsimplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e.\nthe \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceasy\" choice task discussed above, but vary the \nnumber of connections that each agent begins with in order to\nsimultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution\non system behaviour. Tables 1 and 2 show the effect of \ndifferent degree distributions on the equilibrium proportion of\nagents that are satisfied at any one time, and the \nequilibrium proportion of agents switching products (moving) in\nany one time period, under various levels of market barriers\nconstraining their behaviour. In these two tables, \nequilibrium results have been calculated by averaging over time\nperiods 450 to 500, when the system is in equilibrium or\nextremely close to equilibrium (Table 3 and 4 make use of\nall time periods).\nNo WoM \u00ce\u00ba = 1 \u00ce\u00ba = 3 \u00ce\u00ba = 9\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0 0.27 0.44 0.56 0.58\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.05 0.26 0.39 0.50 0.52\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.2 0.14 0.27 0.32 0.34\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.4 0.07 0.17 0.22 0.25\nTable 1: Effect of degree distribution and market\nbarriers on proportion of market satisfied\nNo WoM \u00ce\u00ba = 1 \u00ce\u00ba = 3 \u00ce\u00ba = 9\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0 0.74 0.51 0.45 0.45\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.05 0.66 0.43 0.38 0.37\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.2 0.41 0.21 0.21 0.21\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.4 0.17 0.09 0.09 0.09\nTable 2: Effect of degree distribution and market\nbarriers on proportion of market moving\nThree aspects are worth noting.

The first few connections one makes\nincreases the probability of finding a satisfying product 60%\nfrom 0.27 to 0.44 (for the first two contacts), followed by a\nfurther increase of roughly 25% to 0.56 for the next four.\nIn contrast, adding a further 12 contacts improves relative\nsatisfaction levels by less than 4%. Secondly, word-of-mouth\ncommunication continues to play an important role in \nimproving the performance of the system even when market\nbarriers are high. In fact, the role may even be more \nimportant in constrained conditions, since the relative gains\nobtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market\nbarriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles\nthe aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme \nbarriers (\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.4). Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by\nwhich barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement\n(reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any\nparticular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in\ndegree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely\nthe same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by\nreducing the average amount of time required to find a \nsatisfying brand.\nPositive referrals Negative referrals\n\u00ce\u00ba = 1 \u00ce\u00ba = 3 \u00ce\u00ba = 9 \u00ce\u00ba = 1 \u00ce\u00ba = 3 \u00ce\u00ba = 9\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0 0.21 0.93 3.27 0.00 0.00 0.00\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.05 0.19 0.85 2.96 0.06 0.19 0.60\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.2 0.13 0.57 2.04 0.30 0.92 2.83\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.4 0.08 0.40 1.49 0.60 1.81 5.44\nTable 3: Median number of positive and negative\nreferrals made per agent per time period\nPerhaps the most interesting effects exerted by market \nbarriers are those exerted over the market shares of leading\nproducts. Figure 2 shows the cumulative market share \ncaptured by the top three products in the market over time, for\nall types of market barriers using different degree \ndistributions. Again, two comments can be made. Firstly, in the\nabsence of market barriers, a greater proportion of the \nmarket is captured by the market leading products when \nmarkets are highly-connected relative to when they are \npoorlyconnected. This difference can amount to as much as 15%,\nand is explained by positive feedback within the more \nhighlyconnected networks that serves to increase the probability\nthat, once a set of satisfying products have emerged, one\nis kept informed about these leading products because at\nleast one of one\"s contacts is using it. Secondly, the \nrelatively higher market share enjoyed by market leaders in\nhighly-connected networks is eroded by market barriers. In\nmoving from \u00ce\u00b2 = 0 to \u00ce\u00b2 = 0.2 to \u00ce\u00b2 = 0.4, market leaders\ncollectively lose an absolute share of 15% and 10% under\nthe larger degree distributions \u00ce\u00ba = 9 and \u00ce\u00ba = 3 respectively.\nThe Sixth Intl.

It seems reasonable to suggest that increases in\nnegative word-of-mouth, which occurs when an unsatisfied\nagent is prevented from switching to another product, are\nparticularly damaging to leading products when agents are\nwell-connected, and that under moderate to strong market\nbarriers these effects more than offset any gains achieved by\nthe spread of positive word-of-mouth through the network.\nTable 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both\npositive and negative, as a function of degree distribution\nand extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger \nmarket barriers act to simultaneously depress positive \nword-ofmouth communication and increase negative \ncommunication from those trapped in unsatisfying product \nrelationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for\nmore highly-connected networks. The reduction in the \nnumber of positive referrals as market barriers impose \nincreasingly severe constraints is also reflected in Table 4, which\nshows the median number of product trials each agent makes\nper time period based on a referral from another agent.\nWhereas under few or no barriers agents in a highly-connected\nnetwork make substantially more reference-based product\ntrials than agents in poorly-connected networks, when \nbarriers are severe both types of network carry only very little\npositive referral information. This clearly has a relatively\ngreater impact on the highly-connected network, which \nrelies on the spread of positive referral information to achieve\nhigher satisfaction levels. Moreover, this result might be\neven stronger in reality if agents in poorly-connected \nnetworks attempt to compensate for the relative sparcity of\nconnections by making more forceful or persuasive referrals\nwhere they do occur.\n\u00ce\u00ba = 1 \u00ce\u00ba = 3 \u00ce\u00ba = 9\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0 0.13 0.27 0.35\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.05 0.11 0.22 0.28\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.2 0.05 0.10 0.14\n\u00ce\u00b2 = 0.4 0.02 0.05 0.06\nTable 4: Median number of referrals leading to a\nproduct trial received per agent per time period\n392 The Sixth Intl.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELATED WORK\nPurchasing behaviour in many markets takes place on\na substrate of networks of word-of-mouth communication\nacross which agents exchange information about products\nand their likes and dislikes. Understanding the ways in\nwhich flows of word-of-mouth communication influence \naggregate market behaviour requires one to study both the\nunderlying structural properties of the network and the \nlocal rules governing the behaviour of agents on the network\nwhen making purchase decisions and when interacting with\nother agents. These local rules are often constrained by the\nnature of a particular market, or else imposed by \nstrategic suppliers or social customs. The proper modelling of a\nmechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting \nbehavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of\ncomplex and interacting components: networks of \ncommunication, source credibility, learning processes, habituation\nand memory, external constraints on behaviour, theories of\ninformation transfer, and adaptive behaviour. In this \npaper we have attempted to address some of these issues in\na manner which reflects how agents might act in the real\nworld.\nUsing the key notions of a limited communication \nnetwork, a simple learning process, and a satisficing heuristic\nthat may be subject to external constraints, we showed (1)\nthe importance of word-of-mouth communication to both\nsystem effectiveness and stability, (2) that the degree \ndistribution of a network is more influential than the way in\nwhich agents are connected, but that both are important in\nmore complex environments, (3) that rewiring even a small\nnumber of connections to create a small-world network can\nhave dramatic results for the speed of convergence to \nsatisficing distributions and market share allocations, (4) that\nword-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements\nbetween products are constrained by market barriers, and\n(5) that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a\nresult of market barriers can reduce the market share \ncollectively captured by leading brands, but that this is dependent\non the existence of a suitably well-connected network \nstructure.\nIt is the final finding that is likely to be most \nsurprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field,\nand suggests that it may not always be in the best \ninterests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent \ncustomers from leaving. In poorly-connected networks, the \neffect of barriers on market shares is slight. In contrast, in\nwell-connected networks, negative word-of-mouth can \nprevent agents from trying a product that they might \notherwise have found satisfying, and this can inflict significant\nharm on market share. Products with small market share\n(which, in the context of our simulations, is generally due to\nthe product offering poor performance) are relatively \nunaffected by negative word-of-mouth, since most product trials\nare likely to be unsatisfying in any case.\nAgent-based modelling provides a natural way for \nbeginning to investigate the types of dynamics that occur in \nmarketing systems. Naturally the usefulness of results is for the\nmost part dependent on the quality of the modelling of the\ntwo \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmodules\" comprising network structure and local \nbehaviour. On the network side, future work might investigate\nthe relationship between degree distributions, the way \nconnections are created and destroyed over time, whether \npreferential attachment is influential, and the extent to which\nsocial identity informs network strucutre, all in larger \nnetworks of more heterogenous agents. On the behavioural side,\none might look at the adaptation of satisfaction thresholds\nduring the course of communication, responses to systematic\nchanges in product performances over time, the integration\nof various information sources, and different market barrier\nstructures. All these areas provide fascinating opportunities\nto introduce psychological realities into models of \nmarketing systems and to observe the resulting behaviour of the\nsystem under increasingly realistic scenario descriptions.\n6.
