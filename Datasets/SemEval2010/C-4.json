Thus, the loss of\npackets impairs the application-level utility. For voice this\nutility impairment is twofold: on one hand, even short bursts\nof lost packets may decrease significantly the ability of the\nreceiver to conceal the packet loss and the speech signal \nplayout is interrupted. On the other hand, some packets may\nbe particular sensitive to loss as they carry more important\ninformation in terms of user perception than other packets.\nWe first develop an end-to-end model based on loss \nrunlengths with which we can describe the loss distribution\nwithin a flow. These packet-level metrics are then linked to\nuser-level objective speech quality metrics. Using this \nframework, we find that for low-compressing sample-based codecs\n(PCM) with loss concealment isolated packet losses can be\nconcealed well, whereas burst losses have a higher perceptual\nimpact. For high-compressing frame-based codecs (G.729)\non one hand the impact of loss is amplified through error\npropagation caused by the decoder filter memories, though\non the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss\nconcealment by extrapolation of decoder state. Contrary to\nsample-based codecs we show that the concealment \nperformance may break at transitions within the speech signal\nhowever.\nWe then propose mechanisms which differentiate between\npackets within a voice data flow to minimize the impact of\npacket loss. We designate these methods as intra-flow loss\nrecovery and control. At the end-to-end level, identification\nof packets sensitive to loss (sender) as well as loss \nconcealment (receiver) takes place. Hop-by-hop support schemes\nthen allow to (statistically) trade the loss of one packet,\nwhich is considered more important, against another one of\nthe same flow which is of lower importance. As both \npackets require the same cost in terms of network transmission,\na gain in user perception is obtainable. We show that \nsignificant speech quality improvements can be achieved and\nadditional data and delay overhead can be avoided while\nstill maintaining a network service which is virtually \nidentical to best effort in the long term.\nCategories and Subject Descriptors\nC.2.4 [Computer Communication Networks]: \nDistributed Systems-Distributed applications; (3.2.6 [Computer\nCommunication Networks]: Internetworking-Routers;\nC.4 [Computer Systems Organization]: Performance of\nSystems-itJeasun3nent techniques; C.4 [Computer \nSystems Organization]: Performance of Systems--Modeling\ntechniques\nGeneral Terms\nDesign, Measurement, Performance, Reliability\n1. INTRODUCTION\nConsidering that a real-time flow may experience some packet\nloss, the impact of loss may vary significantly dependent on\nwhich packets are lost within a flow. In the following we\ndistinguish two reasons for such a variable loss sensitivity:\nTemporal sensitivity: Loss of ADUs\" which is \ncorrelated in time may lead to disruptions in the service.\nNote that this effect is further aggravated by some \ninterdependence between ADUs (i.e., that one ADU can\nonly be decoded when a previous ADU before has \nsuccessfully been received and decoded). For voice, as\na single packet contains typically several ADUs (voice\nframes) this effect is thus more significant than e.g. for\nvideo. It translates basically to isolated packet losses\nversus losses that occur in bursts.\nSensitivity due to ADU heterogeneity: Certain ADUs\nmight contain parts of the encoded signal which are\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcApplication Data Unit: the unit of data emitted by a source\ncoder such as a video or voice frame.\n441\nFigure 1: Schematic utility functions dependent on\nthe loss of more (+l) and less (-1) important packets\nmore important with regard to user perception than\nothers of the same flow. Let us consider a flow with\ntwo frame types of largely different perceptual \nimportance (we assume same size, frequency and no \ninterdependence between the frames). Under the loss of\n50% of the packets, the perceptual quality varies hugely\nbetween the case where the 50% of the frames with\nhigh perceptual importance are received and the tax\nwhere the 50% less important frames are received.\nNetwork support for real-time multimedia flows can on one\nhand aim at offering a lossless service, which, however, to\nbe implemented within a pa&et-switched network, will be\ncostly for the network provider and thus for the user. On\nthe other hand, within a lossy service, the above sensitivity\nconstraints must be taken into account. It is our strong\nbelief that this needs to be done in a generic way, i.e.,\nno application-specific knowledge (about particular coding\nschemes e.g.) should be necessary within the network and,\nvice versa, no knowledge about network specifics should be\nnecessary within an application. Let us now consider the\ncase that 50% of packets of a flow are identified as more\nimportant (designated by +l) or less important (-1)\ndue to any of the above sensitivity constraints. Figure 1 a)\nshows a generic utility function describing the \napplicationlevel Quality of Service (QoS) dependent on the percentage\nof packets lost. For real-time multimedia traffic, such \nutility should correspond to perceived video/voice quality. If\nthe relative importance of the packets is not known by the\ntransmission system, the loss rates for the +l and -1 \npackets are equal. Due to the over-proportional sensitivity of the\n+l packets to loss as well as the dependence of the end-t*\nend loss recovery performance on the fl packets, the utility\nfunction is decreasing significantly in a non-linear way \n(approximated in the figure by piece-wise linear functions) with\nan increasing loss rate. Figure 1 b) presents the CBS~ where\nall +l packets are protected at the expense of -1 pa&&.\nThe decay of the utility function (for loss rates < 50%) is\nreduced, because the +l packets are protected and the \nendto-end loss recovery can thus operate properly over a wider\nrange of loss rates indicated by the shaded area. This results\nin a graceful degradation of the application\"s utility. Note\nthat the higher the non-linearity of the utility contribution\nof the fl packets is (deviation from the dotted curve in\nFig. 1 a), the higher is the potential gain in utility when the\nprotection for +l packets is enabled. Results for actual \nperceived quality as utility for multimedia applications exhibit\nsuch a non-linear behavior*.\nTo describe this effect and provide a taxonomy for \ndifferent QoS enhancement approaches, we introduce a novel \nterminology: we designate mechanisms which influence QoS\nparameters between Bows (thus decrease the loss rate of\none flow at the expense of other flows) as inter-flow QoS.\nSchemes which, in the presence of loss, differentiate between\npa&& within a flow as demonstrated in Figure 1 above,\nprovide intra-flow QoS enhancement. As QoS mechanisms\nhave to be implemented within the network (hopby-hop)\nand/or in the end systems (end-to-end), we have another\naxis of classification.\nThe adaptation of the sender\"s bitrate to the current \nnetwork congestion state as an intraflow QoS scheme (loss\navoidance, [IS]) is difficult to apply to voice. Considering\nthat voice flows have a very low bitrate, the relative cost of\ntransmitting the feedback information is high (when \ncompared e.g. to a video flow). To reduce this cost the feedback\ninterval would need to be increased, then leading to a higher\nprobability of wrong adaptation decisions. The major \ndi6culty, however, is the lack of a codec which is truly scalable\nin terms of its output bitrate and corresponding perceptual\nquality. Currently standardized voice codecs ([17]) usually\nonly have a 6xed output bitrate. While it has been proposed\nto switch between voice codeca ([2]), the MOS (subjective\nquality) values for the codecs employed do not differ much:\ne.g., theITU codecs G.723.1, G.729, G.728, G.726and G.711\ncover a bitrate range from 5.3 kbitjs to 64 kbitjs while the\nsubjective quality differs by less than 0.25 on a l-to-5 MOS\nscale ([4], 1: bad, 5: excellent quality). So when the \navailability of sutticient computing power is assumed, the lowest\nbitrate codec can be chosen permanently without actually\ndecreasing the perceptual quality.\nFor loss recovery on an end-to-end basis, due to the \nrealtime delay constraints, open-loop schemes like Forward \nError Correction (FEC) have been proposed ([2]). While such\nschemes are attractive because they can be used on the \nInternet today, they also have several drawbacks. The amount\nof redundant information needs to be adaptive to avoid \ntaking bandwidth away from other flows. This adaptation is\ncrucial especially when the fraction of traflic using \nredundancy schemes is large (181). If the redundancy is a source\ncoding itself, like it has often been proposed ([7]), the \ncomments from above on adaptation also apply. Using \nredundancy has also implications to the playout delay adaptation\n([lo]) employed to de-jitter the packets at the receiver. Note\nthat the presented types of loss sensitivity also apply to \nap\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhile we have obtained results which confirm the shape of\nthe overall utility curve shown in Fig. 1, clearly the utility\nfunctions of the +1/-l sub.flows and their relationship are\nmore complex and only approximately additive.\n442\nTable 1: State and transition probabilities computed\nfor an end-to-end Internet trace using a general\nMarkov model (third order) by Yajnik et. al.

End-to-end mechanisms can reduce and shift\nsuch sensitivities but cannot come close to eliminate them.\nTherefore in this work we assume that the lowest possible \nbitrate which provides the desired quality is chosen. Neither\nfeedback/adaptation nor redundancy is used, however, at\nthe end-to-end level, identification/marking of packets \nsensitive to loss (sender) as well as loss concealment (receiver)\ntakes place. Hop-by-hop support schemes then allow trading\nthe loss of one packet, which is considered more important,\nagainst another one of the same flow which is of lower \nimportance. We employ actual codecs and measure their utility\nin the presence of packet loss using objective speech quality\nmeasurement.\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces\npacket- and user-level metrics. We employ these metrics\nto describe the sensitivity of VoIP traffic to packet loss in\nsection 3. Section 4 briefly introduces a queue management\nalgorithm which can be used for intra-flow loss control. In\nsection 5, we present results documenting the performance\nof the proposed mechanisms at both the end-to-end and \nhopby-hop level. Section 6 concludes the paper.\n2. METRICS\n2.1 Packet-level metrics\nA general Markov model ([19, S]) which describes the loss\nprocess is defined as follows:\nLet P( Z(s) ] Z(s - m),... ,Z(s - 2),Z(s - 1) ) be the state\ntransition probability of a general Markov model of order m,\nwhere Z(s) is the loss indicator function for the packet with\nthe sequence number s. All combinations for the values (0\nand 1) of the sequence Z(s-m), . . . , Z(s-2),Z(s-1) appear in\nthe state space. As an example P( Z(s) = 1 ] Z(s - \n2),Z(s1) = 01 ) gives the state transition probability when the\ncurrent packet s is lost, the previous packet s - 1 has also\nbeen lost and packet s - 2 has not been lost. The number\nof states of the model is 2. Two state transitions can\ntake place from any of the states. Thus, the number of\nparameters which have to be computed is 2m+1. Even for\nrelatively small m this amount of parameters is difficult to\nbe evaluated and compared. Table 1 shows some values for\nthe state and transition probabilities for a general Markov\nmodel of third order measured end-to-end in the Internet by\nYajnik et. al. ([19]). It is interesting to note that for all\nstates with Z(s - 1) = 0 the probability for the next packet\nnot to be lost (Z(s) = 0) is generally very high (> 0.8, in\nbold typeface) whereas when Z(s- 1) = 1 the state transition\nprobabilities to that event cover the range of 0.15 to 0.61.\nThat means that past no loss events do not affect the loss\nprocess as much as past loss events. Intuitively this seems\nto make sense, because a successfully arriving packet can\nbe seen as a indicator for congestion relief. Andren et. al.\n([l]) as well as Yajnik et. al. ([20]) both confirmed this by\nmeasuring the cross correlation of the loss- and \nno-loss-runlengths. They came to the result that such correlation is\nvery weak. This implies that patterns of short loss bursts\ninterspersed with short periods of successful packet arrivals\noccur rarely (note in this context that in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc&able 1 the pattern\n101 has by far the lowest state probability).\nThus, in the following we employ a model ([12]) which only\nconsiders the past loss events for the state transition \nprobability. The number of states of the model can be reduced\nfrom 2m to m + 1. This means that we only consider the\nstate transition probability P( Z(s) ] Z(s - k), . . . ,Z(s - 1) )\nwith Z(s - Ic + i) = 1 V i E [0, Ic - 11, where Ic (0 < k 5 m)\nis a variable parameter. We define a loss run length lc\nfor a sequence of Ic consecutively lost packets detected at\nsj (sj > Ic > 0) with Z(sj - k - 1) = O,Z(sj) = 0 and\nZ(sj - k + i) = 1 V i E [0, Ic - 11, j being the j-th \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc<burst\nloss event. Note that the parameters of the model become\nindependent of the sequence number s and can now rather\nbe described by the occurence ok of a loss run length k.\nWe define the random variable X as follows: X = 0: no\npacket lost, X = k (0 < lc < m): ezactly lc consecutive\npackets lost, and X 2 k (0 < k < m): at least k \nconsecutive packets lost. With this definition, we establish a\nloss run-length model with a finite number of states (m + 1)\nwhich gives loss probabilities dependent on the burst length.\nIn the model, for every additional lost packet which adds to\nthe length of a loss burst a state transition takes place. If a\npacket is successfully received, the state returns to X = 0.\nThus, the state probability of the system for 0 < Ic < m is\nP(X 2 Zc). Due to the limited memory of the system, the\nlast state X = m is just defined as crm consecutive packets\nlost, with P(X = m) being the state probability. Given\nthe case of a finite number of packets a for a flow, which\nexperiences d = cpC1 ]cok packet drops, we have the \nrelative frequency pL,k = 2 (P(X = k) for a + 00) for the\noccurence of a loss burst of length lc. An approximation for\nthe expectation of the random variable X can be computed\nas pi = cr==, #+L,k and identified with the mean loss\nrate. We can also approximate the state probabilities of the\nmodel by the cumulative loss rate p~,~,,~(k) = CrSkp~,,,\n(0 < k < m) and p~,~ = Cr.p=, (n--mzl)ot (k = m). The\ntransition probabilities for 1 < lc < m can be computed\neasily as:\np(k--l)(k) = P(X>klX>k-l)=\nP(X>knX>k-1)\nP(X>k-1)\nZZ\nP ( X > k )\nP(X>k-1)\nThese conditional loss probabilities again can be \napproxPzl,cum(k) _ Cnm,k on\ni m a t e d by PL,cond@) = PL,cum(k-l) - C;Ek--l 0,. For\n443\nFigure 2: Loss run-length model with m + 1 states\nP(X = m]X = m) we have:\nPL,,,d(rn) = %Lf;:P\nFig. 2 shows the Markov chain for the model.\n(1)\nAdditionally, we also define a random variable Y which de\nscribes the distribution of burst loss lengths with respect\nto the bunt loss events j (and not to packet events like in\nthe definition of X). We have the burst loss length rate\nga = * as an estimate for P(Y = k). Thus, the mean\nburst loss length is g = h = e = CT==, kgb\ncorresponding to E[Y] (average loss gap, [5]).\nThe run-length model implies a geometric distribution for\nresiding in state X = m. For the probability of a burst loss\nlength of k packets we thus can compute estimates for \nperformance parameters in a higher order model representation\n(note that here Y represent the random variable used in the\nhigher-order models). For a three state model we have e.g.\nfor P(Y = k):\nP(Y = k) =\nP(Y=k)=l-pm: k=l\npn p;;\" (1 -pm): k 2 2 c-4\nFor the special case of a system with a memory of only the\nprevious packet (m = l), we can use the runlength \ndistribution for a simple computation of the parameters of the\ncommonly-used Gilbert model (Fig. 3) to characterize the\nloss process (X being the associated random variable with\nX = 0: no packet lost, X = 1 a packet lost). Then the\nprobability of being in state m can be seen BS the uncow\nditional loss probability ulp and approximated by the mean\nloss (pr. = pi,,,,). Only one conditional loss probability clp\nfor the transition 1 --t 1 exists:\np~,E-d = CFL(~ - \nlbd (3)\nIf losses of one flow are correlated (i.e., the loss \nprobability of an arriving packet is itiuenced by the contribution\nto the state of the queue by a previous packet of the same\nflow and/or both the previous and the current packet see\nbusty arrivals of other traffic, [15]) we have pal < clp and\nthus ulp 5 clp. For pal = elp the Gilbert model is \nequivalent to a l-state (Bernotilli) model with zllp = elp (no loss\ncorrelation).\nAs in equation 2 we can compute an estimate for the \nprobability of a burst loss length of k packets for a higher order\nmodel representation:\nB(Y = k) = clpk-\u00e2\u20ac\u02dc(1 - clp) (4)\nFigure 3: Loss run-length\n(Gilbert model)\nmodel with two states\nFigure 4: Components of the end-to-end loss \nrecovery/control measurement setup.\n2.2 Objective Speech Quality Metrics\nUnlike the conventional methods like the Signal-t-Noise \nRatio (SNR), novel objective quality measures attempt to \nestimate the subjective quality as closely as possible by \nmodeling the human auditory system. In our evaluation we\nuse two objective quality measures: the Enhanced Mod&d\nBark Spectral Distortion (EMBSD, [21]) and the Measw\ning Normalizing Blocks (MNB) described in the Appendix\nII of the ITU-T Recommendation P.861 ([18]). These two\nobjective quality measure.~ are reported to have a very high\ncorrelation with subjective tests, their relation to the range\nof subjective test result values (MOS) is close to being linear\nand they are recommended as being suitable for the \nevaluation of speech degraded by transmission errors in real \nnetwork environments such as bit errors and frame erasures\n([18, 211). Both metrics are distance measures, i.e., a IB\nsuit value of 0 implies perfect quality, the larger the value,\nthe worse the speech quality is (in Fig. 5 we show an axis\nwith approximate corresponding MOS values). For all \nsimulations in this paper we employed both schemes. As they\nyielded very similar results (though MNB results generally\nexhibited less variability) we only present EMBSD results.\n3. VOIP LOSS SENSITIVITY\nFigure 4 shows the components of the measurement setup\nwhich we will use to evaluate our approach to combined\nend-t-end and hopby-hop loss recovery and control. The\n444\nshaded boxes show the components in the data path where\nmechanisms of loss recovery are located. Together with the\nparameters of the network model (section 2.1) and the \nperceptual model we obtain a measurement setup which allows\nus to map a specific PCM signal input to a speech quality\nmeasure. While using a simple end-to-end loss \ncharacterization, we generate a large number of loss patterns by using\ndifferent seeds for the pseudcerandom number generator (for\nthe results presented here we used 300 patterns for each \nsimulated condition for a single speech sample). This procedure\ntakes thus into account that the impact of loss on an input\nsignal may not be homogenous (i.e., a loss burst within one\nsegment of that signal can have a different perceptual impact\nthan a loss burst of the same size within another segment).\nBy averaging the result of the objective quality measure for\nseveral loss patterns, we have a reliable indication for the\nperformance of the codec operating under a certain network\nloss condition. We employed a Gilbert model (Fig. 3) as the\nnetwork model for the simulations, as we have found that\nhere higher order models do not provide much additional\ninformation.\n3.1 Temporal sensitivity\n3.1.1 Pa4\nWe first analyze the behaviour for ~-law PCM flows (64\nkbit/s) with and without loss concealment, where the loss\nconcealment repairs isolated losses only (speech stationarity\ncan only be assumed for small time intervals). Results are\nshown for the AP/C concealment algorithm ([ll]). Similar\nresults were obtained with other concealment algorithms.\nFigure 5 shows the case without loss concealment enabled\nwhere Gilbert model parameters are varied. The resulting\nspeech quality is insensitive to the loss distribution \nparameter (elp). The results are even slightly decressing for an\nincreasing clp, pointing to a significant variability of \ntheresuits. In Figure 6 the results with loss concealment are \ndepicted. When the loss correlation (dp) is low, loss \nconcealment provides a significant performance improvement. The\nrelative improvement increases with increasing loss (pulp).\nFor higher clp values the cases with and without \nconcealment become increasingly similar and show the same \nperformance at clp x 0.3. Figures 5 and 6 respectively also \ncontain a curve showing the performance under the assumption\nof random losses (Bernouilli model, ulp = elp). Thus, \nconsidering a given ulp, a worst case loss pattern of alternating\nlosses (I(s mod 2) = l,l([s + l] mod 2) = 0) would enable a\nconsiderable performance improvement (with ok = OVk > 1:\np~,cond = 0, Eq. 3).\nAs we found by visual inspection that the distributions of the\nperceptual distortion values for one loss condition seem to\napproximately follow a normal distribution we employ mean\nand standard deviation to describe the statistical variability\nof the measured values. Figure 7 presents the perceptual\ndistortion as in the previous figure but also give the standard\ndeviation as error bars for the respective loss condition. It\nshows the increasing variability of the results with increasing\nloss correlation (clp), while the variability does not seem to\nchange much with an increasing amount of loss (alp). On\none hand this points to some, though weak, sensitivity with\nregard to heterogeneity (i.e., it matters which area of the\nspeech signal (voiced/unvoiced) experiences a burst loss).\nOn the other hand it shows, that a large number of different\nFigure 5: Utility curve for PCM without loss \nconc e a l m e n t (EMBSD)\nFigure 6: Utility curve for PCM with loss \nconcealment (EMBSD)\nFigure 7: Variability of the perceptual distortion\nwith 10s~ concealment (EMBSD)\n445\nFigure 8: Utility curve for the G.729 codec \n(EMBSD)\nloss patterns is necessary for a certain speech sample when\nusing objective speech quality measurement to assess the\nimpact of loss corwlation on user perception.\n3.1.2 G.729\nG.729 ([17]) uses the Conjugate Structure Algebraic Code\nExcited Linear Prediction (CS-ACELP) coding scheme and\nooerates at 8 kbit/s. In G.729. a speech fmme is 10 ms in\nd&ion. For each frame, the\"G.7i9 encoder analyzes the\ninput data and extracts the parameters of the Code Excited\nLinear Prediction (CELP) model such as linear prediction\nfilter coefficients and excitation vectors. When a frame is\nlost or corrupted, the G.729 decoder uses the parameters of\nthe previous frame to interpolate those of the lost frame.\nThe line spectral pair coefficients (LSP3) of the last good\nframe are repeated and the gain coefficients are taken from\nthe previous frame but they are damped to gradually reduce\ntheir impact. When a frame loss occurs, the decoder cannot\nupdate its state, resulting in a divergence of encoder and\ndecoder state. Thus, errors are not only introduced \nduring the time period represented by the current frame but\nalso in the following ones. In addition to the impact of the\nmissing codewords, distortion is increased by the missing\nupdate of the predictor filter memories for the line speo\ntral pairs and the linear prediction synthesis filter memo\nries. Figure 8 shows that for similar network conditions the\noutput quality of the G.729* is worse than PCM with loss\nconcealment, demonstrating the compression versus quality\ntradeoff under packet loss. Interestingly the loss correlation\n(dp parameter) has some impact on the speech quality, \nhowever, the effect is weak pointing to a certain robustness of\nthe G.729 codec with regard to the resiliency to consecutive\npacket losses due to the internal loss concealment. \nRosenberg has done a similar experiment ([9]), showing that the\ndifference between the original and the concealed signal with\nincreasing loss burstiness in terms of a mean-squared error\nis significant, however. This demonstrates the importance\nof perceptual metrics which are able to include concealment\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLSPs are another representation of the linear prediction\ncoefficients.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTwo G.729 frames are contained in a packet.\nFigure 9: Resynchronization time (in frames) of the\nG.729 decoder after the loss of k consecutive frames\n(k E [1,4]) as a function of frame position.\n(and not only reconstruction) operations in the quality \nassessment.\n3.2 Sensitivity due to ADU heterogeneity\nPCM is a memoryless encoding. Therefore the ADU content\nis only weakly heterogeneous (Figure 7). Thus, in this \nsection we concentrate on the G.729 coda. The experiment we\ncarry out is to meawre the resynchronization time of the d*\ncoder after k consecutive frames are lost. The G.729 decoder\nis said to have resynchronized with the encoder when the \nenergy of the error signal falls below one percent of the energy\nof the decoded signal without frame loss (this is equivalent\nto a signal-t-noise ratio (SNR) threshold of 2OdB). The\nerror signal energy (and thus the SNR) is computed on a\nper-frame basis. Figure 9 shows the resynchronization time\n(expressed in the number of frames needed until the \nthreshold is exceeded) plotted against the position of the loss (i.e.,\nthe index of the first lost frame) for d&rent values of k.\nThe speech sample is produced by a male speaker where an\nunvoiced/voiced (au) transition occurs in the eighth frame.\nWe can see from Figure 9 that the position of a frame loss has\na signilicant inlluence cm the resulting signal degradation\",\nwhile the degradation is not that sensitive to the length of\nthe frame loss burst k. The loss of unvoiced frames seems\nto have a rather small impact on the signal degradation\nand the decoder recovers the state information fast \nthereafter. The loss of voiced frames causes a larger degradation\nof the speech signal and the decoder needs more time to\nresyncbronize with the sender. However, the loss of voiced\nframes at an unvoiced/voiced transition leads to a significant\ndegradation of the signal. We have repeated the experiment\nfor different male and female speakers and obtained similar\nresults. lsking into account the wed coding scheme, the\nabove phenomenon could be explained as follows: Because\nvoiced sounds have a higher energy than unvoiced sounds,\nthe loss of voiced frames causes a larger signal degradation\nthan the loss of unvoiced frames. However, due to the \nperiodic property of voiced sounds, the decoder can conceal\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhile on one hand we see that SNR n~easu~es often do\nnot correlate well with subjective speech quality, on the\nother hand the large differences in the SNR-threshold-based\nresynchronization time clearly point to a significant impact\non subjective speech quality.\n446\nFigure 10: Differential RED drop probabilities as\na function of average queue sizes\nthe loss of voiced frames well once it has obtained suflicient\ninformation on them. The decoder fails to conceal the loss\nof voiced frames at an unvoiced/voiced transition because\nit attempts to conceal the loss of voiced frames using the\nfilter coefficients and the excitation for an unvoiced sound.\nMoreover, because the G.729 encoder uses a moving average\nfilter to predict the values of the line spectral pairs and only\ntransmits the difference between the real and predicted \nvaues, it takes a lot of time for the decoder to resynchronize\nwith the encoder once it has failed to build the appropriate\nlinear prediction filter.\n4. QUEUE MANAGEMENT FOR \nINTRAFLOW LOSS CONTROL\nWhile we have highlighted the sensitivity of VoIP traffic to\nthe distribution of loss in the last sections, we now want\nto briefly introduce a queue management mechanism ([13])\nwhich is able to enforce the relative preferences of the ap\nplication with regard to loss.\nWe consider flows with packets marked with +l and \n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI1 (as described in the introduction) BS foreground traffic\n(FT) and other (best effort) flows as backaound traffic\n(BT). Packet marking, in addition to keeping the desirable\nproperty of state aggregration within the network core as\nproposed by the IETF Differentiated Services architecture,\nis exploited here to convey the intrbflow requirements of a\nllow. As it should be avoided to introduce reordering of the\npackets of a flow in the network we consider mechanisms\nfor the management of a single queue with different priority\nlevels. One approach to realize inter-flow service \ndifferentiation using a single queue is RIO (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRED with IN and OUT\",\n[3]). With RIO, two average queue sizes as congestion \nindicators are computed: one just for the IN (high priority)\npackets and another for both IN and OUT (low priority)\npackets. Packets marked as OUT are dropped earlier (in\nterms of the average queue size) than IN packets. RIO has\nbeen designed to decrease the clip seen by particular Bows at\nthe expense of other flows. In this work, however, we want\nto keep the ulp as given by other parameters while \nmodifying the loss distribution for the foreground traffic (FT).\nThis amounts to trading the loss of a +l packet against a\n-1 packet of the same flow (in a statistical sense). Fig. 10\nshows the conventional RED drop probability curve (po as a\nfunction of the average queue size for all arrivals avg), which\nis applied to all unmarked (0) traffic (background traffic:\nBT).\nThe necessary relationship between the drop probabilities\nfor packets marked as -1 and +l can be derived 85 \nfollows (note that this relationship is valid both at the \nend-tend level and every individual hop): Let a = a0 + a+, +a-~\nbe the overall number of emitted packets by an FT flow and\na,, + E [-l,O, +l] be the number of packets belonging to a\ncertain class (where the 0 class corresponds to (unmarked)\nbest effort traflic). Then, with a+, = a-1 = a,~, and \nconsidering that the resulting service has to be best effort in\nthe long term, we have:\naopo + a+lp+l + LIP-1 A ape\nQlll@+l fP-1) = (a--oo)m\nP - l = zpo-p+1 (5)\nDue to this relationship between the drop probability for\n+l and -1 packets, we designate this queue \nmanagement algorithm as Differential RED (DiERED). Figure 10\nshows the corresponding drop probability curves. Due to\nthe condition of a+, = (I-L = all, in addition to the \nconventional RED behaviour, the DiffRED implementation should\nalso monitor the +l and -1 arrival processes. If the ratio of\n+l to -1 packets at a gateway is not 1 (either due to \nmisbehaving flows or a significant number of flows which have\nalready experienced loss at earlier hops) the -1 loss prob\nability is decreased and the +l probability is increased at\nthe same time thus degrading the service for all users. The\nshaded areas above and below the po(avg) curve (Fig. 10)\nshow the operating area when this correction is added.\nIn [13] it has been shown that using only the conventional\nRED average queue size avg for DSRED operation is not\nsufficient. This is due to the potentially missing \ncorrelation of the computed aug value between consecutive +l and\n-1 arrivals, especially when the share of the FT traftic is\nlow. As this might result in a unfair distribution of losses\nbetween the FT and BT fractions, a specific avgl value is\ncomputed by sampling the queue size only at FT arrival\ninstants. Thus, a service differentiation for foreground \ntraffic is possible which does not differ from conventional RED\nbehaviour in the long term average (i.e., in the ulp).\n5. INTRA-FLOW LOSS RECOVERY AND\nCONTROL\n5.1 Temporal sensitivity\nConsidering a flow with temporal loss sensitivity, paragraph\n3.1.1 has shown that a simple, periodic loss pattern enhances\nthe performance of the end-to-end loss recovery. The pattern\nis not tied to particular packets, therefore a per-flow \ncharacterization with the introduced metrics is applicable. In this\nparagraph we assume that a flow expressed its temporal \nse*sitivity by marking its flow with an alternating pattern of\n,c+l,>,\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcc~l,,,\n447\nFigure 11: Comparison of actual and estimated Figure 12: Comparison of actual and estimated\nburst loss length rates as a function of burst length burst, loss length rates as a function of burst length\nk: three state run-length-based model k: two state run-length-based model (Gilbert.)\nFigures 11 and 12 show the rates for the actual and the \nestimated burst loss lengths for a three-state (m = 2) and a\ntwo=state (m = 1, Gilbert) model respectively6. We can\nobserve that DiffRED shapes the burst probability curve in\nthe desired way. Most of the probability mass is \nconcentrated at, isolated losses (the ideal behaviour would be the\noccurence of only isolated losses (Ic = 1) which can be \nexpressed with clp = 0 in terms of Gilbert model parameters).\nWith Drop Tail an approximately geometrically decreasing\nburst loss probability with increasing burst length (Eq. 4)\nis obtainable, where the clp parameter is relatively large\nthough. Thus, considering voice with temporal loss \nsensitivity as the foreground traffic of interest, with DifFRED a\nlarge number of short annoying bursts can be traded against\na larger number of isolated losses and few long loss bursts\n(which occur when the queue is under temporary overload,\ni.e., awg > maxth, Fig. 10).\nWe can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) \nreflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop\nof the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along\na geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2). This effect\ncannot be captured by the two state model (Eq. 4) which\nthus overestimates the burst loss length rate for Ic = 2 and\nthen hugely underestimates it for k > 2. Interestingly, for\nDrop Tail, while both models capture the shape of the \nactual curve, the lower order model is more accurate in the\nestimation. This can be explained as follows: if the burst\nloss length probabilities are in fact close to a geometrical \ndistribution, the estimate is more robust if all data is included\n(note that the run-length based approximation of the \nconditional loss probability P(X = mlX = m) only includes loss\nrun-length occurences larger or equal to m: Eq. 1).\nsWe only discuss the results qualitatively here to give an\nexample how an intra-flow loss control algorithm performs\nand to show how loss models can capture this performance.\nDetails on the simulation scenario and parameters can be\nfound in [12].\n5.2 Sensitivity due to ADU heterogeneity\nIn paragraph 3.1.2 we have seen that sensitivity to ADU\nheterogeneity results in a certain non-periodic loss pattern.\nThus, a mechanism at (or near) the sender is necessary\nwhich derives that pattern from the voice data. \nFurthermore, an explicit cooperation between end-to-end and hop\nby-hop mechanisms is necessary (Fig. 4).\nWe use the result of paragraph 3.2 to develop a new packet\nmarking scheme called Speech Property-Based Selective \nDifferential Packet Marking (SPB-DIFFMARK). The \nDIFFMARK scheme concentrates the higher priority packets on\nthe frames essential to the speech signal and relies on the\ndecoder\"s concealment for other frames.\nFigure 13 shows the simple algorithm written in a \npseudocode that is used to detect an unvoiced/voiced (uw) \ntransition and protect the voiced frames at, the beginning of a\nvoiced signal. The procedure analysis0 is used to classify\na block of Ic frames as voiced, unvoiced, or uv transition.\nsend0 is used to send a block of Ic frames as a single packet\nwith the appropriate priority (either fl, 0 or -1).\nAs the core algorithm gives only a binary marking decision\n(protect the packet or not), we employ a simple algorithm\nto send the necessary -1 packets for compensation (Eq. 5):\nafter a burst of +l packets has been sent, a corresponding\nnumber of -1 packets is sent immediately. State about the\nnecessary number of to-be-sent -1 packets is kept in the\nevent that the SPB algorithm triggers the next +l burst\nbefore all -1 packets necessary for compensation are sent.\nThus, seen over time intervals which are long compared to\nthe +1/-l burst times, the mean loss for the flow will be\nequal to the best effort case (Eq. 5). N is a pre-defined\nvalue and defines how many frames at the beginning of a\nvoiced signal are to be protected. Our simulations (Fig. 9)\nhave shown that the range from 10 to 20 are appropriate\nvalues for N (depending on the network loss condition). In\nthe simulations presented below, we choose Ic = 2, a typical\n448\nprotect = 0\nfcm?ach (k frames)\nclassify = analysis(k frames)]\nif (protect > 0)\nif (classify == unvoiced)\nprotect = 0\nif (compensation > 0)\ncompensation = compensation-k\nsend(k frames, -1)\nelse\nsend(k frames, 0)\nendif\nelse\nsend(k frames, +l)\nprotect = protect-k\ncompensation = compensation+k\nendif\nelse\nif (classify == uvfransition)\nsend(k frames, +l)\nprotect = N - k\ncompensation = compensation+k\nelse\nif (compensation > 0)\ncompensation = compensation-k\nsend(k frames, -1)\nelse\nsend(k frames, 0)\nendif\nendif\nendif\nendfor\nFigure 13: SPB-DIFFMARK Pseudo Code\nvalue for interactive speech transmissions over the Internet\n(20ms of audio data per packet). A larger number of Ic would\nhelp to reduce the relative overhead of the protocol header\nbut also increases the packetization delay and makes sender\nclassification and receiver concealment in case of packet loss\n(due to a larger loss gap) more difficult.\n5.2.1 En.d-to-end simulation description\nDue to the non-periodic loss pattern, we need to explicitly\nassociate a drop probability with a single packet within an\nend-to-end model. Therefore we use a separate one-state\nMarkov model (Bernouilli model) to describe the network\nbehaviour as seen by each class of packets. Best effort\npackets (designated by 0 in Fig. 14) are dropped with the\nprobability pc, whereas packets marked with +l and -1\nare dropped with probabilities of p+i and p-1 respectively.\nThis is a reasonable assumption\" with regard to the \ninterdependence of the different classes in fact, as it has been shown\nthat DiffRED (Figs. 11 and 12) achieves a fair amount of\ndecorrelation of +l and -1 packet losses. Nevertheless to\ninclude some correlation between the classes we have set\np+i = 10m3 pc for the subsequent simulations. This should\n\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe appropriateness of the simple end-to-end modeling\nused has been investigated in [12] with discrete event \nsimulation using a multi-hop topology and detailed modeling of\nforeground and background traffic sources.\nMarking Scheme Network Model\nN O M A R K lolo/ 0~0~0~ 01\nF U L L M A R K +I +I +I +I +l +I\nSPB MARK 1 0 1+I j +I I 0 I 0 / 0\nALT MARK o/+11 Ol+ll o/+1\n+I Pcl\n330 po\nS P B D I F F M A R K 1 IJ / +l I +l I -1 j-1 / 0 I\nALT DIFFMARK I-1 / +I 1-1 1+I /-I 1+I 1\nFigure 14: Marking schemes and corresponding \nnetwork models.\nalso allow a reasonable evaluation of how losses in the fl\nclass affect the performance of the SPB-algorithms.\nFor a direct comparison with SPB-DIFFMARK, we evaluate\na scheme where packets are alternatingly marked as being\neither -1 or +l (ALT-DIFFMARK, Figure 14). We \nfurthermore include related inter-flow loss protection schemes.\nThe first scheme uses full protection (FULL MARK, all\npackets are marked as +l). The SPB-MARK scheme \noperates similarly to SPB-DIFFMARK, but no -1 packets\nare sent for compensation (those packets are also marked as\n0). For comparison we again use a scheme where \npackets are alternatingly marked as being either 0 or +l\n(ALT-MARK). Finally, packets of pure best effort flows\nare dropped with the probability po (NO MARK case in\nFig. 14). For the SPB marking schemes the percentage of\n+l- and -l-marked packets respectively is 40.4% for the\nspeech material used. We obtained similar marking \npercentages for other speech samples. The ALT marking schemes\nmark exactly 50% of their packets as being fl.\n5.2.2 Results\nFigure 15 shows the perceptual distortion for the marking\nschemes dependent on the drop probability pc. The \nunprotected case (NO MARK) has the highest perceptual \ndistortion and thus the worst speech quality*. The differential\nmarking scheme (SPB-DIFFMARK) offers a significantly\nbetter speech quality even when only using a network \nservice which amounts to best effort in the long term. Note\nthat the ALT-DIFFMARK marking strategy does not \ndiffer from the best effort case (which confirms the result of\nparagraph 3.1.2). SPB-DIFFMARK is also even better than\nthe inter-flow QoS ALT-MARK scheme, especially for higher\nvalues of pe. These results validate the strategy of our SPB\nmarking schemes that do not equally mark all packets with a\nhigher priority but rather protect a subset of frames that are\nessential to the speech quality. The SPB-FEC scheme ([12]),\n*We have also perfo rmed informal listening tests which \nconfirmed the results using the objective metrics.\n449\nFigure 15: Perceptual Distortion (EMBSD) for the\nmarking schemes and SPB-FEC\nwhich uses redundancy9 piggybacked on the main payload\npackets (RFC 2198, [7]) to protect a subset of the packets,\nenables a very good output speech quality for low loss rates.\nHowever, it should be noted that the amount of data sent\nover the network is increased by 40.4%. Note that the \nsimulation presumes that this additionally consumed bandwidth\nitself does not contribute significantly to congestion. This\nassumption is only valid if a small fraction of trafhc is voice\n([S]). The SPB-FEC curve is convex with increasing po, as\ndue to the increasing loss correlation an increasing number\nof consecutive packets carrying redundancy are lost leading\nto unrecoverable losses. The curve for SPB-DIFFMARK is\nconcave, however, yielding better performance for pe & 0.22.\nThe inter-flow QoS ALT-MARK scheme (50% of the \npackets are marked) enhances the perceptual quality. However,\nthe auditory distance and the perceptual distortion of the\nSPB-MARK scheme (with 40.4% of all packets marked) is\nsignificantly lower and very close to the quality of the \ndecoded signal when all packets are marked (FULL MARK).\nThis also shows that by protecting the entire flow only a\nminor improvement in the perceptual quality is obtained.\nThe results for the FULL MARK scheme also show that,\nwhile the loss of some of the +l packets has some \nmeasurable impact, the impact on perceptual quality can still be\nconsidered to be very low.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we have characterized the behaviour of a \nsamplebased codec (PCM) and a frame-based codec (G.729) in the\npresence of packet loss. We have then developed intraflow\nloss recovery and control mechanisms to increase the \nperceptual quality. While we have tested other codecs only \ninformally, we think that our results reflect the fundamental \ndifference between codecs which either encode the speech \nwave\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe also used the G.729 encoder for the redundant source\ncoding.\nform directly or which are based on linear prediction. For\nPCM without loss concealment we have found that it \nneither exhibits significant temporal sensitivity nor sensitivity\nto payload heterogeneity. With loss concealment, however,\nthe speech quality is increased but the amount of increase\nexhibits strong temporal sensitivity. Frame-based codecs\namplify on one hand the impact of loss by error \npropagation, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to\nperform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state.\nContrary to sample-based codecs we have shown that the\nconcealment performance of the G.729 decoder may break\nat transitions within the speech signal however, thus \nshowing strong sensitivity to payload heterogeneity.\nWe have briefly introduced a queue management algorithm\nwhich is able to control loss patterns without changing the\namount of loss and characterized its performance for the\nloss control of a flow exhibiting temporal sensitivity. Then\nwe developed a new packet marking scheme called Speech\nProperty-Based Selective Differential Packet Marking for\nan efficient protection of frame-based codecs. The \nSPBDIFFMARK scheme concentrates the higher priority \npackets on the frames essential to the speech signal and relies on\nthe decoder\"s concealment for other frames. We have also\nevaluated the mapping of an end-to-end algorithm to \ninterflow protection. We have found that the selective marking\nscheme performs almost as good as the protection of the \nentire flow at a significantly lower number of necessary \nhighpriority packets.\nThus, combined intra-flow end-to-end / hopby-hop schemes\nseem to be well-suited for heavily-loaded networks with a \nrelatively large fraction of voice traffic. This is the case because\nthey neither need the addition of redundancy nor feedback\n(which would incur additional data and delay overhead) and\nthus yield stable voice quality also for higher loss rates due\nto absence of FEC and feedback loss. Such schemes can \nbetter accomodate codecs with fixed output bitrates, which are\ndifficult to integrate into FEC schemes requiring adaptivity\nof both the codec and the redundancy generator. Also, it\nis useful for adaptive codecs running at the lowest possible\nbitrate. Avoiding redundancy and feedback is also \ninteresting in multicast conferencing scenarios where the end-to-end\nloss characteristics of the different paths leading to members\nof the session are largely different. Our work has clearly\nfocused on linking simple end-to-end models which can be\neasily parametrized with the known characteristic of \nhopby-hop loss control to user-level metrics. An analysis of a\nlarge scale deployment of non-adaptive or adaptive FEC as\ncompared to a deployment of our combined scheme requires\nclearly further study.\n7.
